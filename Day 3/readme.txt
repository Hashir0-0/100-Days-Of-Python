After a long time. I am back again this time I will be consistent no matter what happens.

Sorry got busy in some personal things and uni exams (Tbh its just an excuse because work comes 1st). But not gonna repeat the same mistake it cost me more than anyone can imagine.

Comeback time. Its personal this time.

1. Odd and even numbers:
    Simple thing just a simple odd even number finder using if else statement.

2.BMI Calculator (Updated one):
    Simple Calculator as the last one but a little advance because it uses if else statement in this one and tells you about your body weight.

3.Leap Year:
    Program that finds out the leap year by just giving some input.

4. Pizza Order:
    Uses some complex if else statements to give the total bill of the order you gave.

5. Love Calculator:
    Shows compaltibility with your partner on basis of some words. Not true tbh lol.

6. Roller Coaster:
    Just a program for a ride at ammusement park. Kinda interactive and fun.Have alot of features.

7. Treasure Island:
    Last and the final project of the day which decides the choices on the basis of user input.

Thats all for today see ya All tomorrow.
